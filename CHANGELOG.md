# Changelog — agent-workflow (monorepo)

Repo-level history for the **agent-workflow** family monorepo. Each published package is
versioned **independently** — see its own changelog for package-level detail:

- `@sabaiway/agent-workflow-kit` → [agent-workflow-kit/CHANGELOG.md](agent-workflow-kit/CHANGELOG.md)
- `@sabaiway/agent-workflow-memory` → [agent-workflow-memory/CHANGELOG.md](agent-workflow-memory/CHANGELOG.md)

## 2026-06-21

- **First publish from the monorepo.** Released `@sabaiway/agent-workflow-memory@1.0.0` (initial
  standalone release of the memory substrate) and `@sabaiway/agent-workflow-kit@1.4.0` to npm,
  both with build provenance, in that order (the kit may delegate to memory at deploy time).
  Release tags: `agent-workflow-memory-v1.0.0`, `agent-workflow-kit-v1.4.0`.
- **Root CI workflows added** under `.github/workflows/`:
  - `publish` — manual dispatch for `memory`, `kit`, or `both` (with `dry_run`); runs the
    per-package preflights + provenance publish via the reusable `_publish-one`, always
    memory → kit.
  - `stats` — daily snapshot of per-package npm downloads plus shared repo signals into
    `stats/history.csv`.
  - `unpublish` — guarded admin unpublish with a `memory | kit` selector.

## Earlier

The family was refactored out of the standalone `agent-workflow-kit` project into this monorepo:
the memory substrate was extracted into its own package and the kit became the composition root
(detect-and-delegate, with a bundled fallback). For package history before the monorepo, see the
per-package changelogs linked above.
