# Debt queue

Rows queued out of a review round instead of folded. Each carries a stable id the flow store's
`queued` disposition binds to. A row leaves this file only when the work lands.

- **LINE-SAFETY-TEST-FULL-RANGE** — the `UNSAFE` byte list in
  `agent-workflow-kit/tools/lens-region.test.mjs` samples 11 boundary code points while the
  comment and the composer contract claim the full C0/DEL/C1/U+2028/U+2029 range; generate the
  array from the complete ranges (U+0000–U+001F, U+007F–U+009F, U+2028, U+2029) and use it in both
  checks, so a byte the composer misses cannot slip between samples. Queued at the Phase-1 round
  cap (a test-breadth minor; the composer itself already covers the full range by construction);
  land it with the next lens-region-touching Step of this plan.
- **CODEX-CATALOG-EMPTY-EFFORTS-REMEDY** — `codex-cli-bridge/bin/codex-exec.sh:1054` and
  `codex-review.sh:487` split the catalog parser's answer with `IFS=$'\t' read`; TAB is IFS
  whitespace, so an empty field collapses. An effective entry with `supported_reasoning_levels: []`
  sends `effort<TAB><TAB><slug><TAB><level>` and the refusal prints `offered: <slug>` and the remedy
  `CODEX_MODEL=<level>` / `CODEX_EFFORT=` (spec bridge-model S9 wants the default or one whole
  entry). The refusal itself is right. Narrow fix: a `\x1f` separator in the parser's join and the
  `IFS`, or an empty array read as unreadable like an absent one; one cell in
  `codex-model-posture.test.mjs`, mirrors synced. Raised by codex and the review lens at the S1 diff
  council (2026-10-03); the shape is one codex does not ship.
- **AGY-REVIEW-HARNESS-SANDBOX-LEAK** — `makeSandbox` in
  `antigravity-cli-bridge/bin/agy-review-harness.test.mjs:188` creates an `agy-review-test-*` dir
  under `tmpdir()` that nothing removes (the `after` hook at :161 removes only the shared root), so
  every suite importing it — `agy-model-posture.test.mjs:34` included — leaves one directory per
  cell. Narrow fix: create sandboxes under `SHARED_ROOT`, or register each `home` for removal in the
  harness. Raised by codex at the S1 diff council (2026-10-03).
- **CODEX-EXEC-ACCOUNTED-LANE-COMMENT** — the section comment at `codex-cli-bridge/bin/codex-exec.sh:682`
  says "everything below fires only for a NONCED run", but the catalog check (:998-1070) sits below it
  and runs on every invocation. Comment-only; move the catalog block above the section header or
  scope the sentence to the mint core. Found while folding the S1 diff council (2026-10-03).
- **POSTURE-READ-NUL-IS-SILENT** — `aw_read_posture` (the shared settings span, e.g.
  `codex-cli-bridge/bin/codex-exec.sh:279`, byte-identical in all four wrappers) reads the line with
  `grep "^${key}=" "$file"`; a NUL anywhere in the settings file switches GNU grep to binary mode, no
  line comes back, and the model key silently takes the default — spec bridge-model S17 wants a
  warning for a control byte. Narrow fix: a separate NUL check on the file before the read (bash
  drops NUL bytes in a command substitution, so the value screen can never see one) that warns once
  and keeps the default; a cell per bridge suite, the parity span kept byte-identical. Raised by codex at the S1 diff council round 2 (2026-10-03).
- **POSTURE-SUITES-ASSUME-TIMEOUT-BINARY** — `codex-cli-bridge/bin/codex-model-posture.test.mjs:13`
  and `antigravity-cli-bridge/bin/agy-model-posture.test.mjs:14` resolve only `timeout`; on a host
  with only `gtimeout` (macOS + coreutils) `REAL_TIMEOUT` is empty and the fake-timeout cells `exec ""`.
  Narrow fix: resolve `timeout || gtimeout` and skip the bounded-read cells when neither exists.
  Raised by codex at the S1 diff council round 2 (2026-10-03).
- **POSTURE-KIND-ADMITS-LINE-SEPARATORS** — the `posture` kind (`agent-workflow-kit/tools/manifest/validate.mjs:59`)
  refuses only edge whitespace, so `--set 'AGY_MODEL=Bogus<U+2028>X' --apply` passes; `KEY_LINE_RE`'s `(.*)$`
  (`bridge-settings-read.mjs:27`) cannot cross U+2028, the judgment then sees no key, judges the default and writes an
  unoffered model (the wrappers' `grep` reads it and refuse every run). Narrow fix: the kind refuses
  `[  ]`, and `KEY_LINE_RE` reads `([^\n]*)` as grep does; one S7 cell. Raised by the review lens at the
  S2 diff council (2026-10-03). Same class: `hasControlByte` (`bridge-settings-read.mjs:166`) misses NUL, so a
  hand-edited `CODEX_MODEL=x<NUL>` file line reads `[setting]`, prints the raw NUL and refuses a later
  `--set CODEX_EFFORT`, while the wrappers' grep sees a binary file and runs the default; fix `[\x00-\x1f\x7f]`
  for the posture lane (raised by the lens at round 2).
- **CATALOG-LOOKUP-PATH-DIFFERS-FROM-WRAPPER** — `agent-workflow-kit/tools/bridge-catalog.mjs:56` resolves `agy` on
  the caller's PATH only, while `agy.sh:66` and `agy-review.sh:567` put `$HOME/.local/bin` first: with `agy` only
  there the read-out says "not installed" and a set goes unchecked; a second `agy` earlier on PATH is read instead.
  The lookup also ignores PATHEXT, so a native-Windows `codex.cmd` reads "not installed". Narrow fix: for agy,
  prepend `$HOME/.local/bin` to the lookup and the child's PATH. Raised by the review lens at the S2 diff council.
- **CATALOG-BOUND-WAITS-FOR-CLOSE** — `bridge-catalog.mjs` settles a timed-out read only on `'close'`; a descendant
  that left the process group (setsid) and holds stdout survives both kills and the read never settles (the
  wrapper's `$(timeout …)` hangs the same way). Narrow fix: the SIGKILL timer also destroys `child.stdout` and
  finishes `unreadable`. Raised by the review lens at the S2 diff council.
- **CATALOG-EFFORT-PARSE-DIVERGES** — `bridge-catalog.mjs:31` adds `l.effort !== ''`, which the wrappers'
  `effortsOf` (`codex-exec.sh:1034`, `codex-review.sh:468`) lacks: an entry with an empty effort reads "efforts
  unknown" in the kit (a set goes unchecked) and a list in the wrapper. Narrow fix: one rule in all three copies.
  Raised by the review lens at the S2 diff council.
- **POSTURE-RENDER-FOLDS-WHITESPACE** — `agent-workflow-kit/tools/bridge-posture.mjs:21` shows a posture value
  through `oneLine()`, so a value with a non-breaking or doubled space renders like the offered default while the
  wrapper passes the raw string and refuses it. Display only. Narrow fix: show the raw value JSON-escaped when it
  differs from `oneLine(value)`. Raised by the review lens at the S2 diff council.
- **POSTURE-SNAPSHOT-DROPS-REFUSAL** — `agent-workflow-kit/tools/bridge-settings-read.mjs:260` keeps no note in the
  snapshot's posture rows, so a control-byte env `CODEX_MODEL` renders `model=none (environment)` while the
  wrappers refuse the run. Display only. Narrow fix: carry a refused flag and render the refusal; keep `none` for
  an explicitly empty `AGY_MODEL`. Raised by codex at the S2 diff council (2026-10-03).
- **POSTURE-KIND-HEADER-COMMENTS** — `agent-workflow-kit/tools/bridge-settings.mjs:7-8` and
  `agent-workflow-kit/tools/manifest/validate.mjs:39-42` say every value the writer accepts passes the wrappers'
  `aw_settings_valid`; for the `posture` kind that function has no case (`*) return 1`, `codex-exec.sh:211`, the
  span byte-identical in all four wrappers) — the wrappers read those keys through `aw_read_posture` (non-empty, no
  control byte). Comment-only, no run-time effect. Narrow fix: scope both sentences to the applied kinds and name
  `aw_read_posture` as the wrapper side of `posture`. Raised by the review lens at the S2 attestation round.

## Closed

- **PARITY-RESOLVE-TERNARY** — queued when the fix (one redundant `isAbsolute` ternary spelled twice)
  reached outside the phase that raised it, then FOLDED in a later round of the same step: correcting
  the wrapper-link resolution base required touching both call sites anyway, and the check is no
  longer redundant there — it now decides whether the physical parent has to be resolved at all.
